This is a test of using movie as the skybox with ThreeJS. An underwater short movie is loaded into the scene as the skybox material, then wrapped onto a sphere geometry created by ThreeJS. Finally, a 3D fish model is added to the scene. Since the movie "boundary" can be seen if you rotate the camera freely, this will be seen as artifacts. To avoid this, you can uncomment the code for restricting the camera rotation angles.
